# Advent of code

My attempts at solving https://adventofcode.com/ challenges.

Install dependencies:

`yarn install`

To run challenge code: check the command in last line of each .js file

## Troubleshooting

Most of challenges were solved on windows machine. Therefore `input.txt` parsing might not work on macOS. Particularly parsing new lines `\r\n`. If running on macOS just remove `\r`.
